# samsi-deep-learning
Practical materials for the Deep Learning course at SAMSI/Duke-UNC-NC State, using the PyTorch DL framework.

## Installation

* Make sure you have a working Python 3 environment. We recommend you to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

* After that, you need to install PyTorch. This course is based on PyTorch 1.2, which is the most stable version at the time of this writing. You can install from [here](https://pytorch.org/)

## Topics

1. An introduction to the pytorch framework. What does it have to offer compared to numpy etc? [notebook](https://github.com/vicgalle/samsi-deep-learning/blob/master/1_intro_to_pytorch.ipynb)

2. A basic logistic regression and multilayer perceptron for the MNIST dataset. [notebook](https://github.com/vicgalle/samsi-deep-learning/blob/master/2_mnist.ipynb)

3. Intro to NLP using torchtext, the IMDB dataset and both an LSTM network and a Transformer. [notebook](https://github.com/vicgalle/samsi-deep-learning/blob/master/3_rnn_imdb.ipynb)

4. Intro to adversarial examples, attacking a convolutional network. [notebook](https://github.com/vicgalle/samsi-deep-learning/blob/master/4_cnn_adversarial.ipynb)

5. Intro to generative adversarial networks, using the MNIST dataset. [notebook](https://github.com/vicgalle/samsi-deep-learning/blob/master/5_intro_gans-full.ipynb)
